**INTRODUCTION**

This Project covers on the basics of c *recursion* using examples.
*Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way*
The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

**CONTENT**

This project contains the following tasks and their solutions;

- [A function that prints a string using recursion](0-puts_recursion.c)
- [A function that prints a string in reverse](1-print_rev_recursion.c)
- [A function that returns the length of a string.](2-strlen_recursion.c)
- [A function that returns the factorial of a given number](3-factorial.c)
_ [A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y](4-pow_recursion.c)
- [Function that returns the natural square root of a number](5-sqrt_recursion.c)
- [Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0](6-is_prime_number.c)
- [function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not](100-is_palindrome.c)
- [function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0](101-wildcmp.c)
