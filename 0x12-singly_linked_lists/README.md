**INTRODUCTION**

This Project covers on the basics of linked lists in C.
A *linked list* is a collection of “nodes” connected together via links. These nodes consist of the data to be stored and a pointer to the address of the next node within the linked list.

**CONTENT**

2. [Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list\_t list.](1-list_len.c)
3. [Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list\_t list.](2-add_node.c)
4. [Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list\_t list.](3-add_node_end.c)
5. [Write a function that frees a list\_t list.](4-free_list.c)
6. [Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.](100-first.c)
