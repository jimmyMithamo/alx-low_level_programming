**INTRODUCTION**
This project covers on the basics of the *malloc* and the *free* functions in C that allocate and free memory respectively.

**CONTENT**
Solutions to the following tasks are provided:

1. [Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.](0-create_array.c)
2. [Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.](1-strdup.c)
3. [Write a function that concatenates two strings.](2-str_concat.c)
4. [Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.](3-alloc_grid.c)
5. [Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc grid function.](4-free_grid.c)
6. [Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.](100-argstostr.c)
7. [Write a function that splits a string into words.](101-strtow.c)
