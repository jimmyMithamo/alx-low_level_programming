**INTRODUCTION**
This project covers on the basics of *C Static Libraries*.A static library is a **collection of object code that is linked with your program at compile-time.**
It contains precompiled functions and code that are copied into your program's executable.

**CONTENT**

The project contains solutions for the following tasks;

1.  A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
* [A static library that contains the functions provided.](libmy.a)

2. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future.
* [A script that creates a static library *liball.a*.](create_static_lib.sh)
