**MORE FUNCTIONS AND NESTED LOOPS**

This project covers on functions and nested loops.
We have used examples to show how they are supposed to be used.
**The following has been covered:**

1. *A function that checks for upper case letters*
2. *A function that checks for a digit*
3. *A function that multiplies two integers*
4. *A function that prints from numbers 0 to 9*
5. *A function that prints from numbers 0 to 9 without 2 and 4*
6. *Function that prints from 0 to 14, ten times*
7. *function that draws a straight line in the terminal using underscore*
8. *function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal using backstroke*
9. *function that prints a square using #*
10. *program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz*
11. *function that prints a triangle using character #*
