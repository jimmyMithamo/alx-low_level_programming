**Debugging in Software Development**

It is the process of identifying and fixing errors, or bugs, in software applications.
Debugging can be a complex and challenging process that requires a methodical approach. It is a skill that is essential to software development, and it is important to learn how to debug effectively.

**Rubber Duck Debugging**

One popular technique for debugging is known as *"rubber duck debugging."* This involves explaining the problem to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object) in order to better understand it. The process of explaining the problem can help identify any gaps in understanding and clarify the issue at hand.

***Best Practices for Debugging***

1. **Understand the problem:** Take the time to fully understand the problem you are trying to solve. Gather as much information as possible about the issue and the conditions under which it occurs.

2. **Reproduce the issue:** Try to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment. This can help isolate the issue and make it easier to debug.

3. **Use debuggers:** Debuggers are powerful tools that can help you identify and fix errors in your code. Learn how to use a debugger effectively.

4. **Test as you go:** Test your code as you write it. This can help catch errors early in the development process and make debugging easier.

5. **Keep a record:** Keep a record of the errors you encounter and how you fixed them. This can be helpful in case you encounter a similar problem in the future.

This project covers on few ways on hoe to debug through:
1. Creating a file that tests for the accuracy of a function.
2. Commenting out on the part that causes an error.
3. Fixing the code from a wrong piece of code.
4. Fixing a function that does not work correctly on all days and years.
